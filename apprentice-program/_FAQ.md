# The Mission of VMLY&R's Tech Apprenticeship Program
The Tech Apprenticeship program aims to help VMLY&R build a world-class technology practice by:

- Discovering and cultivating exceptional non-traditional, diverse tech talent
- Regulating VMLY&R tech staffing ups & downs through continuous, yet cost-effective, feeding of the talent pipeline
- Teaching the next generation of technologists how to lead and be led, through guided feedback for apprentices and coaches

### How do I apply to the VMLY&R Tech Apprenticeship program?

**Email the following items to [lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com](mailto:lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com).  Use subject line: "Tech apprenticeship application for \<First Last\>"** with (of course) your name.

1. a link to your video (make sure we can access it!)
1. a copy of your resume
1. a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub presence, if available
1. any other relevant notes

### When do you accept applications for the program?
We accept applications at any time.  Potential candidate-to-project matching may occur any time throughout the year, as needed.

### I applied!  What happens next?
Within 1-2 days, you should expect a confirmation that your email was received and that we were able to access all of the necessary pieces of info.  After that, hiring managers will be able to access this info as their staffing needs evolve.

### What happens to my application if it doesn't meet current business needs?  How long is my application stored and when should I re-apply?
Your application will be kept on file for one year.  If you want to update your submission with a new video or resume, simply re-submit with a note to replace your previous submission.  

### What do I do if I applied but I'm no longer available/interested?
You can email [lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com](mailto:lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com) to be removed from the candidate list.  Or simply let us know that you're not available/interested if we reach out later.  No biggie.

### How do VMLY&R hiring managers get an apprentice?
Hiring managers (project leads) in development with funded, secured work fill out an internal form to indicate their interest.  This leads to exploring a list of candidates to fit the need while internal HR due diligence and paperwork is pursued.

### Do I have to graduate from a coding bootcamp or similar program to be considered?
No, but it helps.  We partner with organizations like [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org) when we see that their curriculum and student base is a good fit for our needs.  If you have _not_ completed a rigorous, structured coding program, it's harder for us to gauge your level of knowledge and commitment.  For higher level roles (the next level up from "Tech Apprentice" is "Tech Associate"), we would normally look to work or client experience.  But apprentices are not expected to _have_ any professional development experience.  So it can feel like a bit of a dead end.

If you're considering whether a coding bootcamp is right for you, reach out to [david.mitchell@vmlyr.com](mailto:david.mitchell@vmlyr.com), [lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com](mailto:lyndsey.padget@vmlyr.com), or [shanice.gipson@vmlyr.com](mailto:shanice.gipson@vmlyr.com).  They'd be happy to chat with you about your career and needs, and offer suggestions on next steps.

### Will you consider apprentice candidates outside the Kansas City area?
Yes.  In 2020, most technologists demonstrated their ability to learn and work remotely.  While we prefer that the apprentice/coach relationship be in person, it may not be absolutely necessary, either.  Apprentice candidate pools may now include bootcamp grads that are willing to relocate to Kansas City.

Apprentices are an evaluation period, and as such, apprentices will not be required nor expected to move to Kansas City for the first 6 months of their apprenticeship.  After that, conversations between you and your manager (who is informed by your coach) should drive the relocation decision.

### I don't have professional development experience.  After joining, what if I struggle to succeed?
VMLY&R can be a competitive place, but we want you to be successful and will do everything we can to ensure you have ample guidance and support.  There are multiple ways of escalating concerns, from talking directly with your coach or manager, to filling out a survey, to reaching out to HR.

Sometimes, the right person is in the wrong role.  There _may_ be opportunities to "rotate" to different practices within Technology.  For example, you might move from Development to TechOps, or TechOps to AQ.  Rotations are also not necessarily an indication of any problem - we would like for all apprentices to have the opportunity to try new things!  That said, rotations are _driven by_ the apprentice and their coach or manager, and _contingent upon_ the staffing conditions amongst projects.

### What is the difference between a coach and a manager?
VMLY&R uses a simplified version of [the Spotify org model](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify).  _Pods_ provide management structure and support, while _teams_ provide client and project focus.

Apprentices report to a pod manager like any of our other technologists would.  Apprentices have 1-on-1's with their manager weekly.

Unlike other roles, apprentices also have a coach, who is on the same team as the apprentice.  Apprentices "shadow" the coach to gain comfort and understanding of the role.  They pair program regularly (usually daily) and the coach helps connect the apprentice with others who can provide guidance and pairing.  A coach communicates with the apprentice many times per day to ensure they have the support they need to be successful and comfortable at VMLY&R.

### Are Apprentices Contractors?
Yes.  Nearly _all_ new technologists at VMLY&R (not just apprentices) are contractors.  If all goes well, they are later converted to full time employees.

### Will I get stuck on a team that doesn't want an apprentice?
No.  Cultivating leadership and making space for new, diverse talent is a critical part of how we grow our Technology practice.  This expectation is something we discuss amongst ourselves often.

Apprenticeships are a trial period for both the apprentice and the employer, but we don't take this responsibility lightly.  After 6-12 months we generally know if the relationship will be fruitful or not.

### Are Apprentices able to receive paid training or attend conferences?
No.

Learning is a core part of an apprentice's role.  Apprentices are expected to learn in a variety of ways (pair programming, Googling, reading documentation and books, watching videos, following tutorials, etc).  This learning should be infused in a natural way into the work they are helping support.  A good guideline is the 80/20 rule; 80% time doing, 20% time consuming learning materials.

If you believe that you could benefit from paid training or attending a conference, and that it is relevant and necessary to your work, reach out to your coach or manager to discuss this on a case-by-case basis.  There are usually free and less time-consuming alternatives.

If you want to do paid training or attend a conference, you are welcome to use their own funds and PTO for that purpose.

### Do Apprentices get Paid Time Off?
PTO depends on the hiring circumstances.

If you are asked for a follow-up interview and VMLY&R offers you an apprenticeship, we will likely refer you to one of our trusted hiring partners.  Most hiring partners pay for 11 VMLY&R holidays plus 2 weeks of PTO annually, but this is not guaranteed.

### Can Apprentices Participate in VMLY&R Foundation Day?
Yes, but this is not included in paid VMLY&R holidays.  They are invited to participate, but they must use a day of PTO.

### How do Rotations Work?
A "rotation" is an opportunity to move to a different practice within the Technology organization.  For example, you might move from Development to TechOps, or TechOps to AQ.  Rotations are an important part of the apprenticeship program, but "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".  Rotations will be initiated based on feedback from you, your coach, and your manager.  If a rotation is set to occur, there will be plenty of notice for all.
